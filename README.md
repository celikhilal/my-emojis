# my-emojis
The push() method was used to add emojis to the end of the array, and the unshift() method to add emojis to the beginning of the array.
The pop() method was used to delete the last emoji, and the shift() method is used to delete the first emoji.
We created these methods in the addEventListener method where we manage the buttons.
